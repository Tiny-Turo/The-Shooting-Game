Problem Statement

I need a way to keep the gun system modulable - so it is easy to add types of bullets, receivers, barrels and all sorts of things.

I need a clean way to handle multiple scenes, including a clean menu setup - making it easy to add functional buttons and menus.

Solution

Have a scene manager - each scene should be a class with an update function
